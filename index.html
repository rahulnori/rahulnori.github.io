  <p>I am a passionate Application Development, Data Management, Program Optimization and Cloud Architecture enthusiast. I work in the Public Sector realm for The State of Minnesota in the Minnesota IT Services (MNIT) division. In my role as the Systems Supervisor, I manage and lead the PeopleSoft application development teams for the Human Capital Management (HCM), Enterprise Learning Management (ELM) and interaction HUB suites within PeopleSoft. In addition to managing the development team, I also work as a developer and technical lead on projects, upgrades, and for implementing POCs. I earned my masters in Computer Science from the University of Alabama (UA) in 2011 (Roll Tide!). Over my career in academics, I have researched and published peer reviewed articles on green computing, robotics, smart grids, program optimization, molecular modeling of proteins and high performance distributed computing. An interesting fact about me: I love to travel, experience food and make friends from across the globe. That has taken me to 46 states within the US and about 15 countries across the globe (and counting). You would find me doing something that would be a combination of those activities during my leisure time.</p>
